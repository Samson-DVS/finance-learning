# Introduction to the Basics of Finance

## Overview

In this module, we are getting introduced to the basics of finance. To begin learning finance, it's important to understand the role and structure of firms, since they are central to creating wealth in society.

## The Role of Firms in Society

Think about your daily routine. In the morning, you might head to your favorite local cafe or Starbucks for a cup of coffee. The local cafe is a small business, while Starbucks is the largest coffeehouse chain in the world. Although they both serve coffee, they operate very differently. This brings up the question: **How do businesses organize themselves, and why?**

If you're thinking about starting a business, you might wonder: **What's the best way to organize it?**

## Corporations and Employment

When we go to work, we’re likely working for a corporation, which provides a lot of employment opportunities. This makes us ask: **What’s the structure of a firm? Who owns a corporation?**

## Examples of Business in Our Daily Lives

Businesses are all around us, shaping our daily lives. Here are some examples:

- Buying groceries from local stores or big retailers like Walmart or Target
- Shopping online at Amazon
- Using computers made by Apple, Dell, or Hewlett-Packard
- Watching movies from companies like Disney, Warner Brothers, or Universal
- Using streaming services like Netflix and Disney Plus
- Depositing money in banks like Bank of America, Chase Bank, or Citibank
- Driving cars from Ford, Toyota, or Volkswagen
- Flying with American Airlines or Delta Airlines
- Staying at hotels like Hilton

It’s hard to imagine a world without businesses. In fact, some companies become iconic:

- **Coca-Cola** is almost synonymous with soft drinks.
- **McDonald's** is the first thing that comes to mind when we think about hamburgers and fries.
- **Hershey** is the go-to for candy bars.
- We even say "Google it" when we need to search the web.

These businesses don’t just meet basic needs; they also shape our culture and way of life.
